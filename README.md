# Overview

An Open-Source application for the study of music theory and keyboard skills that takes input from a MIDI keyboard and outputs staff notation. Various analytical vocabularies of melody and harmony are represented. As a practice aid and exercise platform that operates across aural, visual, and tactile domains, this tool accelerates the acquisition of fluency in certain fundamentals of tonal music.

# Quickstart

- Requires [Python 2.7.x](http://python.org/download/releases/) and [Pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) to install. 
- To install Pip, see [their instructions](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ospreyelm/HarmonyLab.git harmony
$ cd harmony
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ ./manage.py runserver
```
You should now be able to run the application on your localhost at ```http://127.0.0.1:8000```. 

# Supported Web Browsers

Chrome is currently the only browser supported, being the single browser that implements the WebMIDI specification.

# Heroku Deployment

This application can be deployed to any platform that supports python and django. One such example is 
[heroku](https://heroku.com/), a cloud platform as a service provider, which makes it easy to deploy changes
directly from the git repository. 

Read the [Getting Started on Heroku with Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction)
instructions to get an idea of how it works. You will need to setup an account login and then create an "app".

The required  **Config Variables** that should be added on the app settings page are as follows:

```
SECRET_KEY = YOUR_RANDOM_LONG_PASSWORD
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = harmony.settings.heroku
LTI_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS = {"harmonykey":"harmonysecret"}
```

In the root directory of the git repo, use the heroku CLI to login and then deploy the code to heroku:

```bash
$ heroku login
$ git push heroku master
```

If the build succeeded, you should be able to visit the webpage of the app. Heroku provides a handy shortcut:

```bash
$ heroku open
```
