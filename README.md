# Overview

An Open-Source application for the study of music theory and keyboard skills that takes input from a MIDI keyboard and outputs staff notation. Various analytical vocabularies of melody and harmony are represented. As a practice aid and exercise platform that operates across aural, visual, and tactile domains, this tool accelerates the acquisition of fluency in certain fundamentals of tonal music.

# Quickstart for local development

- Requires [Python 3.6.x](http://python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) to install. 
- To install Pip, see [their instructions](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

On Linux:
```sh
$ mkdir AnalyticPiano && cd AnalyticPiano
$ git clone --single-branch --branch dev https://github.com/ospreyelm/HarmonyLab.git dev
$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv   # unless already installed
$ python3 -m venv pianoenv
$ source pianoenv/bin/activate
$ cd dev
$ pipenv install
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql   # unless already installed
$ sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2   # unless already installed
$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev   # unless already installed
$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="harmony.settings.local"
$ # ^ Multiple local clones will use the same database
$ ./manage.py makemigrations   # not always necessary
$ ./manage.py migrate
$ ./manage.py createsuperuser   # optional: create admin account
$ ./manage.py runserver
```
You should now be able to run the application on your localhost at ```http://127.0.0.1:8000```.

```sh
$ # USE APP
$ # Follow terminal instructions
$ deactivate
```

# Supported Web Browsers

Chrome is currently the only browser supported, being the single browser that implements the WebMIDI specification.

# Heroku Deployment

This application can be deployed to any platform that supports python and django. One such example is 
[heroku](https://heroku.com/), a cloud platform as a service provider, which makes it easy to deploy changes
directly from the git repository. 

Create a Heroku app with the Python buildpack and the Herok Postgres add-on. Deploy from the desired branch of this Github repository; automatic deploys are good for testing the basic playing interface, but these should be disabled when creating course and exercise data.

The required  **Config Variables** that should be added on the app settings page are as follows:

```
SECRET_KEY = YOUR_RANDOM_LONG_PASSWORD
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = harmony.settings.heroku
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["yoururl.com"]
# LTI_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS = {"your_lti_key":"your_lti_secret"} # optional
```

To set up the app and create an admin account for creating course and exercise data, use the Heroku CLI as follows:

```bash
$ heroku login # one-time setup
$ heroku apps # view app names for your login
$ heroku run python manage.py migrate --app HEROKU_APP_NAME
$ heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser --app HEROKU_APP_NAME
```
